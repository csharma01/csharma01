# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chakshu Sharma
This is my portfolio for showcasing my skills and projects as a fresher in Python development. Here you will find a list of my projects and skills that demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming and my dedication to continuous learning.

##  Projects
- **Carpool Application using Python and Tkinter**

  I developed a carpooling application using Python and Tkinter that allows users to easily find and connect with others who are headed in the same direction. With this app, users can create and join carpools for work, school, or social events, making it easier to share the ride. The app uses a simple user interface, allowing users to quickly search for available carpools, view the ride details.
