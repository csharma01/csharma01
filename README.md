## Key Projects

### London Air-Quality Forecasting (MSc Dissertation)
* **Tools:** Python, LightGBM, Geospatial Analysis
* Integrated 3 government datasets (LAQN air quality, DfT traffic, Open-Meteo weather) handling more than 100 monitoring sites across London.
* Engineered more than 5 temporal, traffic, and policy features (ULEZ zones, COVID lockdowns) with lagged pollutant values.
* Built ML models like Random Forest and LightGBM achieving R-squared of 0.63 (NO2) and 0.56 (PM2.5), outperforming baseline by 41%.

### Predicting Patient Survival with Random Forests
* **Tools:** Python, Random Forest, SMOTE, scikit-learn
* Built a complete ML tutorial to enhance a Random Forest classifier using the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset.
* Applied SMOTE to handle critical class imbalance in the medical data.
* Demonstrated a full workflow including feature scaling, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) to improve metrics like recall and F1-score.

### Global Economic Dashboard
* **Tools:** Azure, Flask, MySQL, APIs
* Built an automated ETL pipeline pulling more than 95 economic indicators from public APIs (World Bank, IMF) with scheduled refreshes.
* Designed a MySQL database with indexing and caching, reducing page load times to less than 1 second.
* Developed an interactive Flask dashboard with geospatial visualizations for non-technical users; deployed on Azure with Docker.

### New York City Dog-License Analysis
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Statistical Analysis
* Analyzed more than 1M records to identify a 35% increase in dog licenses post-2019, correlating with COVID-19 WFH trends.
* Cleaned and validated a messy government dataset, handling missing values and duplicate records.

### Honey Production Clustering & Forecasting
* **Tools:** Python, Time-Series, Clustering
* Applied K-means clustering to identify 4 distinct regional production patterns across US states.
* Built an ARIMA forecasting model achieving 8% MAPE for price predictions and identified a data quality issue (currency unit change in 2018).
